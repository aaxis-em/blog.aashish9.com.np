## Introduction

A black hole is an astronomical body so compact that its gravity prevents anything, including light, from escaping.

A Schwarzschild black hole is a theoretical black hole that is spherically symmetric, non-rotating, and uncharged, described by the Schwarzschild solution to Einstein’s field equations.And this is what we are trying to make atleast trying :/.

## Motivation

There’s a part of me that wants to be a physicist. I romanticize astronomy: stars, planets, comets, black holes.
The universe is far stranger and more beautiful.

I made this about 4 years ago in blender I don't know what it is and what i had at my mind at that time but looks like i wanted to make some combination of galaxy,particle binary stars or something i don't know but here is what I rendered at that time.

Six months ago I ran into General Relativity, and it finally gave structure to ideas that used to feel abstract. Time dilation, length contraction suddenly they weren’t quirks, but consequences. Time wasn’t special or separate; it was just another dimension, fused with space into spacetime.

This raytracer won’t fully follow General Relativity we’re taking shortcuts to keep it manageable as a mini project. The focus is on creating something that looks right, rather than simulating every detail of curved spacetime. It’s computer graphics first, physics second.
